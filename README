Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start up the bot

How it works
On launch, the bot downloads a json lookup table from a Google sheet that contains photoset IDs & tags used as hashtags in tweets. A cron task updates the lookup table daily.
The bot pulls a random photoset first, then picks a random photo from the photoset. Image title is used for the tweet status, with hashtags added from the tags property of the lookup table.
Tweets are scheduled via cron tasks.
